custom_test_framworks: for no external libraries and #[no_std] env
 - collects all functions annotated with a #[test_case]
 - invokes a user-sepcified runner function with list of tests as argument

After executing tests, 'test_runner' returns to 'test_main' function
- returns to _start entry function.

To communicate between CPU and peripheral HW on x86
- memory mapped I/O: memory address is mapped to some memory on VGA device
- port mapped I/O: each peripheral has one or more port numbers and communicate with cpu instruction in and out
    (takes a port number and a data type)

isa_debug_exit uses port-mapped I/O
when a value is written to I/O port specified by iobase, causes QEMU to exit with exit status (value << 1) | 1
- value 0 -> 1, 1 -> 3

Serial Port: way to send data. QEMU can redirect bytes sent over serial to host's standard output or a file
UART: the chips implementing a serial interface
- uses multiple I/O ports for programming different device registers

cargo test waits until the test runner exits.
- test that never returns can block the test runner
- bootimage has a timeout. exceeding timeout considers it as Timed Out

Integration test and VGA buffer tests.
When _start functions of main.rs and lib.rs grow, they call various initalization routines before runing test_main function.
- two tests will be executed in different environments

Integration tests: treated as separate executable.
- gives control over the environments
- can test that the code interacts with CPU or HW device correctly

CPU exception: code performs invalid operations (divide by 0)
Page tables: defines which memory regions are valid and accessible
Userspace program: limited access to system's resource
